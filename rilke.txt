Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?
And even if one of them suddenly pressed me to his heart:
I would perish in the overwhelming power of his existence.
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror,
that we are just able to endure, and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to destroy us.
